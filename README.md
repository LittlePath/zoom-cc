# zoom-transcript
W3C Web Component to display closed captions / live transcript in a Zoom video call.

If you are the host of a Zoom call and you don't see a "CC (Closed Caption)" button in your Zoom toolbar, follow Zoom's instructions to enable closed captioning: https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/207279736-Using-closed-captioning 

NOTE: This Web Component currently only works in Google Chrome due to vendor support. Hopefully Mozilla, Microsoft, and others will fully support the W3C SpeechRecognition API in the future. Visit CanIUse.com for a current list of supported browsers: https://caniuse.com/mdn-api_speechrecognition
